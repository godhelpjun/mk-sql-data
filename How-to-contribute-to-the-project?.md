At the moment the app supports only some target types of test data. You are welcome to support the project by providing sample data of your country in order to enlarge the community which can use mk-sql-data. Send me please

- a text file with common prenames
- a text file with common surnames
- a text file with zips and cities
- a text file with street names
- a text file with a longer text

The longer text must not be copyrighted, it could be, for example, the text of an old famous novel in the target language.

I will then add your test data to the app and publish them with the next release of mk-sql-data.
