mk-sql-data runs for me on a Linux-machine with PHP 5, but it should run on other platforms, too. Please do
inform me, when you made it to run the app with another operating system.

The app generates SQL code for MySQL databases. The code should be usable for other databases, too as no special features from MySQL are used. Give it a try and inform me, when you succeeded in using the generated code with another SQL dialect, please. You cannot use the commands [[INCREMENT .. DEPENDING ON .. IN TABLE]] and [[FETCH .. USING]] as you would need another interface than mysqli from PHP. Maybe you want to program this interface? It would be very easy.
